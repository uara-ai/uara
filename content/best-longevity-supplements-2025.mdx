## What Are Longevity Supplements?

Longevity supplements are compounds studied for their ability to extend lifespan, slow aging, or reduce the risk of age-related diseases. Unlike generic vitamins, these supplements target cellular processes such as **inflammation, mitochondrial function, and DNA repair**.

## Top Science-Backed Longevity Supplements

### 1. Vitamin D3

- **Role:** Supports immune function, bone health, and reduces all-cause mortality.
- **Evidence:** Multiple large studies confirm vitamin D deficiency is linked with reduced lifespan.

### 2. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA & DHA)

- **Role:** Improve cardiovascular health and reduce systemic inflammation.
- **Evidence:** Associated with lower risk of heart disease and improved longevity.

### 3. Magnesium

- **Role:** Regulates over 300 biochemical reactions, essential for muscle, nerve, and metabolic health.
- **Evidence:** Higher magnesium intake is linked to reduced risk of premature death.

### 4. Creatine

- **Role:** Enhances muscle strength, brain energy metabolism, and protects against neurodegeneration.
- **Evidence:** Emerging studies link creatine to improved healthy aging beyond athletic performance.

### 5. Curcumin

- **Role:** Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compound found in turmeric.
- **Evidence:** Shown to reduce chronic inflammation, a driver of accelerated aging.

### 6. NAD+ Boosters (NMN, NR)

- **Role:** Support mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.
- **Evidence:** Promising early research suggests NAD+ precursors may slow aspects of biological aging, though human data remains limited.

### 7. Rapamycin & Metformin (Emerging Therapies)

- **Note:** These are prescription drugs under investigation as longevity interventions. Clinical trials are ongoing.
